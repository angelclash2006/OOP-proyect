# POO-proyect
This project consists of the development of a domotic circuit simulator made in Python. The team members are Carlos Raul Rojas Vergara, Angel Arturo Varela Duque, and Javier Camilo Orduz Acero, all students of Electronic Engineering at the National University of Colombia, for the Object-Oriented Programming course.

Within the design process, the first stage is ideation and the creation of the conceptual design. At this step, we need to define the productâ€™s functional and non-functional requirements, create graphical sketches of the UI, and develop high-level diagrams as part of the brainstorming for the technical design and the future software implementation. Everything related to this step is located in the folder "Workshop_1".
